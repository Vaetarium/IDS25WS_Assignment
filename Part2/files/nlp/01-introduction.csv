2.35,31.36,"Okay, a very warm welcome to this first lecture of Introduction to Data Science. So this lecture will be a bit atypical, right? In later lectures, we typically look at one specific problem and then talk about the algorithms to address this. But today is a kind of overview telling you practical things about how the course is organized, etc. So this is a bit different."
31.36,59.41,than the normal lectures will will be let me just get started so as i just mentioned i would like to talk a bit how is this course organized i'm happy to answer any questions that you have related to that and then i start with a bit of an overview with the relatively boring things like what is data etc etc but also giving a bit of a preview of things that you will see later
59.92,90.26,"So let's just dive into it. So what are the rules of the game, right? So the people that are here, they know when and where the lecture is, although they do not know exactly the time at which it starts, it seems. But here is an overview of the entire course. So we try to provide you with all the information, right? When are the lectures? What are the topics? When are the deadlines for the assignments, et cetera, et cetera, right? And you can see that here."
90.35,120.32,"You also see that there is a long list of topics. So this is a course. It's a data science course. In the title, it says introduction. But at the same time, it's at the master level. So what we will do is we will cover many different topics. So we are not focusing on one particular aspect of data science. It's very broad. But in various areas, we will go, let's say, quite deep."
120.32,149.54,"And here you can see a list of topics. So it's very broad. So in this course, you have the opportunity to learn many different things. In the end, you will see a pattern that many of these things have lots of things in common. But in the beginning, all of this will be a bit confusing and it all looks different. But after a while, you will see that there are central things and central problems that we are trying to address. On Moodle,"
149.54,186.42,"So has everybody who has not registered on Moodle who is here? So there are a few. I hope it's not because you have a technical problem. So Moodle is the system that we use to... Also the slides that I'm showing you now are already on Moodle. So you can take a look at that. That's also the platform that is used for, let's say, assignments and all kinds of things."
186.42,216.85,"So on Moodle, which you have access to, so if there are people that have problems with this for whatever reason, that there is a problem with a registration or something like that, we can also add people as a viewer, right? So that you can see things even though you are not registered yet. So there is a lot of information and I will just summarize some of the things that are there. So these are the people that are involved in this course."
216.85,246.5,"So I will be giving most of the lectures. And here you see, let's say, the other, let's say, people involved in this course, mostly of all PhDs from the Process and Data Science group. One is sitting there. So there is Aaron. And Aaron is like also, let's say, a bit the head of the team. But what is also indicated in the box there, and that's very important, never send."
246.5,274.75,"emails to individual people, right? Because you do not know how the work is distributed and that leads to all kinds of coordination problems, right? If you just approach a random person. What you will see over time is that certain topics, I don't know, sequence mining, for example, is handled by a very specific person, right? And we provide this one email to make this smooth."
274.75,296.75,"Perhaps a few things about myself. So we have four children and a dog, as you see. As you can hear from my accent, I'm Dutch, although I was born in the wrong country because I love the mountains. As you know, we live very close to the highest point of the Netherlands, and then you realize how depressing that is."
297.23,324.18,"I'm also known as the godfather of process mining because I'm basically the inventor of the topic of process mining. Some of you have heard about it, others did not hear about it. That will be one of the topics that we will, let's say, cover towards the end a bit. Next to being a professor here, I'm also the chief scientist of Salonis, which is the leading process mining company."
324.34,351.49,"I'm also one of the directors of the AI Center. So you see a picture here of all the directors of the AI Center. I'm also head of the ICT profile area, although I realize that for you as a student, you have no idea what the profile area is. But in two weeks, our university will go again for the excellence status. We will be reviewed again."
351.49,381.02,"And then these structures play a very important role. And they are kind of essential for our financing. So these are a few words about myself, a few words about the group. So the Process and Data Science Group, BATS, is trying to bridge, let's say, processes and data or AI-related topics. So traditionally, lots of the research was..."
381.02,407.73,"either on processes with process modeling, simulation, and these types of things, or it was on machine learning, data mining, data science, et cetera, et cetera. And we are one of the few groups or one of the first groups trying to combine these two areas. And the connecting tissue between these two fields, as you will see later, is the topic of process mining, where you are trying to find out"
407.79,438.5,"in processes, what are, let's say, the problems, where are the bottlenecks, where are the deviations, et cetera, et cetera, and doing this in a data-driven way. A topic that we will talk about later. I already indicated that there are things like, I don't know, the AI center here at RWTH, there are things like the profile area ICT. So I just encourage you, specifically because you're"
438.5,467.87,uh you are master students you're also going into let's say doing a master thesis here at this university so please be aware of this ecosystem and things that you can exploit during your studies right because it would be stupid not to use the the the things that are out there so as a group some of the people in our group are also let's say working for Fraunhofer and
467.87,495.15,"At this campus, as I said, I'm the chief scientist of Salonis. Also at this campus, there is like an office of Salonis here in Malata. Practical things, you know where you are, right? Later this week, it will be in a bit of a smaller room on the other side of the building. Then it will be a bit, let's say, cozy."
495.22,525.42,"But experience shows that after a couple of weeks, this is not a problem anymore. The typical issue that I think you see in any lecture at the beginning of the semester, there is a space problem. Halfway this semester, all the buildings seem empty. It's simply the way that it is. This is not an online course, so you're supposed to be here. I already got many."
525.42,554.45,uh let's say personal emails from i don't know students all over the world whether asking me whether they actually have to be here yeah and the answer is it's your own responsibility right we do not force you to be in this room but definitely at the end there will be like a written exam where you have to be present and also there will be a group assignment and doing a group assignment while you are i don't know not physically here
554.45,583.66,"I think is not very good. It's not very nice. But that's your own responsibility. As I mentioned, this is not an online course. I talked about the things that are here. There are some old recordings already online. And as you can see, Video Ake is so nice to make, let's say, new recordings this year. And they will be provided to you. So all of this will be there."
584.34,614.06,"What is the material? So you do not have to buy these books. And there is not one book that is able to cover all of the different things that we are talking about. But these are books that I will often refer to. But the idea is that the slides are kind of stand-alone, sufficient information for you to do it. But of course, this also works better if you are actually at a lecture."
614.06,640.37,"rather than that you look at the slides and try to understand them. As I said, there is not a single textbook on the topic. So this is just the nature of this course. It's a collection of many, many things. You will learn a lot. And there is not a single book or a single tool that would support this. You will also be doing assignments."
640.37,665.9,"And that will be, let's say, moved through to Evita Moodle. So the rhythm is that there are two lectures per week on Monday and on Wednesday. And on every Thursday there is an instruction. It typically follows the stuff that has been discussed in the same week or the week before. So that is one part."
665.9,695.82,"The other part is that you will do an assignment. I will talk about that later. And this assignment is hands-on because I think the best way for you to learn is that you hear about an algorithm, you understand what it is doing, and that you're then applying it yourself to a data set and that you experience how that actually works, right? I think everybody agrees that that is the best way to learn this, but you have to force yourself to also actually do this."
695.82,723.49,"And that's why we have these, let's say, assignments where you have to do that. In these assignments, we are using Python and various Python libraries where we indicate to you what you should use. So this is not a programming course. This is a data science course. But some basic understanding of Python is assumed. If you go to RWTH Moodle,"
723.49,752.11,"you will see that there is also information for the people that are, I don't know, that are new to this topic to get started with it. It is not super difficult. It is not the goal of this course. But you need to be able to apply these types of things yourself. And I think also everybody realizes that if you would like to become a data scientist, if you cannot use Python, you will not have a job, right? It's part of the thing that you need to do."
752.78,783.78,"So if you go to Erwita & Moodle, you will find more information. Also, please, if there are, let's say, some open issues there, ask at the instruction, like if you have specific problems there. And this will be developed, let's say, over time. Examination and assignments. So there is an assignment consisting of two parts. So in total, the hands-on assignment part,"
783.78,811.52,"is 40% of your grade. The remaining 60% is a written exam. And that is with the distribution that you have this. You need to pass both. So if you simply skip doing the assignments, there is no point in taking the exam because you cannot pass. So you need to pass the assignments in order..."
811.52,840.98,"to participate in the exam in a meaningful way, right? The assignment is done in groups of two or three people. I will say a bit more about that. Also note that in this course, in the end, you get a single grade, right? So it is not, so some people think, okay, let's do the assignment this year and take the exam next year. That is not possible."
840.98,862.54,"There is one grade, so you either do the course now or you don't do it. That's the way that it works. And I'm saying this very explicitly because in my mailbox I see many questions where people know that this is the case but still ask for it."
862.67,892.67,"Then here you can see some dates. So these are the dates of the written exam at the end. So the first exam is in February. I highly recommend to do this one because then you still have a backup plan if things do not work. If you just go for the second option, like you're taking a risk, right? If you have a blackout on that day, it is risky. And then there are these two parts that together count for 40% and here you can see the deadlines."
892.67,922.42,"And the deadlines are chosen in such a way that you already got the theory, you have got the hands-on part, and then you can apply it yourself. Of course, you should not copy things yourself. You should understand what you're doing, et cetera, et cetera. I think, like in any lecture, people will say this, but we will actively check for this. And if we have doubts about whether you actually did it yourself,"
922.42,952.38,"Or you had just a chat GPT doing it for you. We cannot check it. But if we have, let's say, doubts, we will invite you and ask you to talk about it. And then immediately it becomes clear after five minutes whether you actually understood what you did or not. So that is a standard thing. Then already before, when I was standing here before, people asked me about, can I do this course?"
952.38,981.7,"I think that was a student from mathematics that asked that. And we are open for people to take this course. So probably there are also people in the room that are, for example, studying physics. That's very typical. Or mechanical engineering or whatever. So we are open for everybody to take this course. We think it's a topic that is important for multiple disciplines."
981.7,1010.8,"It is mandatory for the data science master, and it's a while pflicht for these, let's say, master courses. If you do not belong to one of these categories, you need to check with your study whether you can actually list this, whether it actually counts. Let's say from our perspective, it's okay, but we cannot control your study program if it's not one of the standard ones."
1010.8,1040.29,"whether you are allowed to take this or not. That's not our duty. If people have problems with registration or something like that, there is this email address that I also showed before to try to find a temporary solution. But in the end, you need to be registered, of course. In the end, you need to be in Moodle in the normal way. When we started this course in 2018,"
1040.29,1069.2,"I was one of the very few professors that was, let's say, covering, let's say, data-related topics. What you see over the last eight years is that many new professors have joined RWTH that are doing data science-related topics, right? And that's because this area is so important and that many young professors that start their career, they are now starting in this area, right?"
1069.2,1098.51,"So some overlap is unavoidable, right? So you will probably, if I think about a topic like regression, so next week you will kind of get a crash course in regression in one lecture, but you may have seen that before, right? And please understand that this is unavoidable because we do not know exactly what your background is, and many of these things are also electives."
1098.51,1127.46,"that we cannot assume that you have taken this, right? So please understand this, that some of the weeks that you will see will be completely new for you. Other weeks you will say, okay, I've seen this part before, right? But yeah, that is to your benefit in a way, right? So then you can focus on the things that are new. We will also touch a bit on topics like, for example, process mining."
1127.46,1157.62,"as I explained before, and there are dedicated courses to many of the topics that we'll talk about. So, for example, if you want to go very deep in machine learning, which is a topic that we will also talk about backpropagation, gradient descent, etc., etc., but if you would like to go very deep in that area, then you can take courses, for example, with Bastian Leiber, who will go much deeper in that topic."
1157.97,1187.44,"Do not underestimate it, and this is related to the point that I just made. Some things look very familiar, and they think, okay, I've seen this before, easy, but there will also be parts that are completely, I don't know, different to things that you've seen before. In Moodle, there is a Q&A feature where you can post questions. I encourage you to do so, and also other students can see this."
1187.7,1216.75,"What we see from experience is that lots of people are posting questions typically related to the assignment. But please also ask things about, let's say, the theory that I can, let's say, come back to that in the lecture. Of course, you don't post things that are very specific for you. If there are things that are very specific for you, use this email address that I indicated before."
1217.23,1247.25,"If you are a PSD or you are an exchange student or something like that, and by that you are not registered as a student here, we can write certificates, etc. Whether things are acknowledged on the other side is, let's say, your problem. It is not our problem. Also, people always forget there are certain deadlines related to registration for the various parts."
1247.25,1274.91,please I don't know note them down in your calendar and simply do it because otherwise like we cannot help you this also this applies very specifically to the assignments right so the assignments there is a very clear deadline communicated long before you can start uploading preliminary versions if you want let's say days before please do that
1274.91,1303.66,"You have no idea that each year we get messages from students that said, oh, I forgot or whatever. And then they fail the course because of something very stupid. This is often also the group dynamics inside the group. So please make sure that if you form a group that you interact actively starting from week one. If you start interacting the week before the deadline."
1304.75,1341.31,"You will play the game of chicken with each other. And the game of chicken, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work. So that's your own responsibility to do so. So let me stop here. Are there questions related to the organization of the course? Yeah? German time means on time. It means German time because some of the people interpret this as Hawaii time."
1341.31,1373.14,"And that gives them half a day extra to do that. Like in science, that's very common, right? If you're submitting papers to a conference, always the time zone is indicated. Because if you have people from all over the world, that is not so deterministic. But just to indicate that we take this very precise, right? And if you want to gamble, feel free to do so. But you cannot blame us afterwards if your gamble fails, right? Other questions?"
1374.83,1402.83,"No? Then, as I said, I talk a bit about, let's say, the input data later, but I start with, let's say, some very general slides talking about why this field is very relevant. And I think for some of the things this resonates, probably because you are here, that you already know these things. I assume everybody knows Moore's Law, that you've seen this graph a zillion times."
1402.83,1431.97,"And Moore's law says that every two years, the number of transistors on a chip is doubling. That's the graph that you've seen. And that leads to, let's say, this 30 million increase over a period of 50 years. And the interesting thing is that Moore's law applies to many things relevant for data science and for computing. So you can look at storage processing and..."
1431.97,1462.1,"communication. You can look at all of these fields. You can look at things becoming cheaper, things becoming faster, and things becoming smaller. And what is surprising, that in all of these different fields, you see exactly the same phenomenon. So the lines in this diagram, they are supposed to indicate like a straight line, but the scale is logarithmic. So that means that things have become"
1462.1,1491.38,exponentially smaller exponentially faster and exponentially cheaper right the cost of storing one bit has been decreasing let's say at the same rate as all the other things yeah so if you look at large language models then you can see that because of all the money that is being pumped into this system
1491.38,1516.06,"that it's even going faster. What you see is that if you look at the size of AI models over the last couple of years, it has been growing four times per year. So much faster than Moore's law. And the only reason why this is possible is because also exponentially more money is poured into the domain. That's why..."
1516.06,1543.44,"Many people, including myself, are very afraid that we are in a kind of bubble that will explode because of all the money that goes into it. But at the same time, it leads to, let's say, spectacular, let's say, engineering things that are happening to make this possible. So if you, what you see here is, so flop is floating point operation. So let's say one computation."
1543.44,1574.35,"If you then look at the largest foundation models to train them, you need 10 to the power 26, so one with 26 zeros, computations to create such a model. And this doesn't mean anything. 10 to the power 26, it doesn't ring any bells in your brain. But if I take a look at my laptop here,"
1574.42,1604.4,"Then I can compute, because you can see the performance of my laptop there, how many instructions it can handle per second. And then I divide these two numbers. So to compute that model on this laptop would take over 600,000 years. So it gives an idea of the thing. And then you may think, yeah, this is like one laptop. We have supercomputers these days."
1604.4,1633.36,"So as you probably know is that the fastest supercomputer in Europe is standing not far from here. It's standing in Jülich. There we have the Jupiter computer where we are also building foundation models. And even if you look at Jupiter, the fastest computer in Europe, it still takes three years to compute this model."
1633.55,1658.58,"And this is showing how much hardware is running at this point in time to make all of this possible. This is when we talk about performance related things. This is just to trigger you that these things are very relevant. If you can save a factor 2 here, that is a lot of money that you can gain."
1658.96,1688.46,"Therefore, it's interesting that, of course, we look at Moore's law and we look at the innovations in hardware, but if you look at the innovations in software, it has been even more spectacular. For many problems, software has become, running on the same hardware, has become, let's say, the performance improvement there is higher than the performance improvement in hardware. And this combination,"
1688.46,1719.07,"is leading that over, for example, if you look at a standard problem like mixed integer program, which is often used in data science techniques in the background, although you don't see it, that the hardware in this period got 20 times faster, the software got 50 times faster, so the total is 1,000 times faster. And this is relevant because of the things that I indicated before. So that's hardware. If I look at social, let's say, aspects,"
1719.07,1748.83,"Then what we can see, and specifically since, let's say, the chat GPT moment, is that it becomes very clear that many jobs will disappear and will change, right? So there are all of these reports. Also, the World Economic Forum is publishing a report every year talking about what are the jobs that are growing and what are the jobs that are, let's say, disappearing."
1748.83,1770.32,"And this will be, in the coming, let's say, 20 years, this will be one of the biggest, probably most important developments that we see is how our jobs are going to change. There are also websites like willrobotstakebyjob.com."
1770.45,1799.18,"which you should take with a grain of salt, as I write in the title. But there you can simply type the name of a profession. And I gave some examples here. And then it talks about the risk that your job will no longer exist. And due to ChatGPT, things have changed here differently than people expected. So if you look at the job of a consultant,"
1799.18,1829.14,"A consultant was considered to be like a high-profile job that would exist forever, right? But if the job of a consultant is to generate text and PowerPoints, it is very clear that this job is very much endangered. We also thought, and I still think that certain types of programming are incredible, let's say, intellectual challenges."
1829.14,1858.38,"that for many years, people will have to do that. But at the same time, many of the, let's say, low-end programming jobs are disappearing at a spectacular rate. And nobody expected that that would happen. So this is showing that all of these things will have societal impact, and that for you it is interesting, because you are, let's say, still in your studies,"
1858.38,1888.05,"to think what will be jobs that are very important in the future. And these will probably be jobs where either, from a technical point of view, you are at, I don't know, top 10%, right, that you are doing the things that algorithms and software cannot do, or you are in this area where you're translating things, needs from businesses, et cetera, into"
1888.05,1918.62,"let's say, data science questions, programs, et cetera, et cetera. So this is just to make you think a bit about this. So these developments are amazing. At the same time, not everything is changing, let's say, so much. We all have a smartphone in our pockets. It's amazing what the thing can do. But at the same time, I don't know, if you go to a cafe and you order a cappuccino,"
1918.62,1948.54,"not so much has changed, right? So things are spectacular, but at the same time, certain things do not change so much. And also, often our expectations are very much exaggerated. So this is a very famous quote. It's now 10 years old, where Elon Musk was, and he made the same claim many, many times after that, where he was claiming, okay, the next full autonomous car,"
1948.54,1977.07,"will be available in the next three months. Apparently it's not so easy. So if you now see where self-driving taxis are driving, they're typically driving in the south of the US where the weather is good under, let's say, certain conditions that are very easy. They are not driving in Rome yet. And that probably will take some time. Or they're not driving in Helsinki or in Moscow or something like that."
1977.65,2008.46,"So this is not so easy. Also, Jeffrey Hinton, let's say the Turing Award winner on, let's say, backpropagation, he also made claims that, okay, we do not need to have, let's say, people being able to look at these x-rays. Algorithms will do that. This was also completely wrong. So certain predictions, it seems that things are going very fast, but at the same time, things are going notoriously slow."
2009.36,2039.18,"We tend to rely a lot on, let's say, automated algorithms. And this is an example that I often show. The data is a bit outdated, but the principle is still exactly the same. So here you look at the best algorithms to classify whether a car should stop for a traffic light or not. So in all of these pictures you see a traffic light."
2039.63,2069.22,"And there are competitions of looking at these images and then deciding whether the car is going to stop or not. And these algorithms are performing exceptionally well. This is older data. But if you would look at newer data, on the example data it will be almost flawless. Much better than you as a human would do it. But now I tell you one disturbing thing."
2069.22,2098.64,"In these images, I typically only need to change two pixels and the neural network will change the decision from red to green or from green to red. So it works very well, but there are vulnerabilities that I just change the input just a small bit. You as a human would still see exactly the same picture. Nothing would have changed, but the decision would have swapped."
2100.27,2129.71,"Not random. You look at... So the claim is here is that you... Because if it's random, it will have the same performance as before. No. If you know how the neural network works, you change two pixels, and that's enough to swap the thing. So that's also how you can hack these types of systems. So if this is a security system, you know that you can make somebody look like somebody else."
2129.71,2166.72,"for the neural network by just changing a bit. There are all kinds of tricks, right? And if you look at, let's say, accidents with self-driving cars, so for example, there can be a truck that has, I don't know, a stop sign printed on it, and it's moving. For you as a person, it's completely clear that that is not a stop sign. But for an AI, they just see a stop sign, right? And they will stop."
2166.72,2198.64,"So that's the way it works. So it's amazing, but at the same time, let's say, as humans, we need to be able to interpret what these things are doing and what has happened. Another thing is that things work well if there is lots of training data. So self-driving cars are trained by lots and lots of different images, but there should be no changes."
2198.67,2229.62,"And if you look at many problems where you would like to apply, let's say, these types of techniques, there are changes. So if you, for example, look at, I don't know, COVID, the supply chain crisis, et cetera, et cetera, it changed things completely. So I'm showing you this picture is that you have training data to train your system. But then if you put it into a new environment, it may not work at all."
2229.62,2257.38,"It would be the same as that you would train Tesla cars, I don't know, in California, and then you suddenly start applying them, I don't know, in Rome. That would not work because it's out of distribution. And you can see if there is concept drift, so things are changing, that things like that do not work. So there is this shiny, let's say, outside of when we look at these techniques."
2257.38,2286.35,"But if you look at the inside, there is often lots of engineering, lots of, let's say, possible problems that you need to address, and you need to know what you're doing. And that's why you are taking this course, that you understand these techniques, and that you can use, let's say, your human interpretation to look at these things. In this context, we often use the term hybrid intelligence."
2286.48,2312.9,"And what we are seeing is that many tasks that were previously done by people are slowly being done by algorithms and hardware. But there is a balance between it. And for many tasks, it is best to use a combination. I talked earlier about that Jeffrey Hinton made this wrong estimate."
2312.9,2339.74,"that we do not need doctors to interpret x-ray machines. And what you see is what works best is a combination of an algorithm and a doctor. So the algorithm is giving you diagnostics, it gives you x-ray information, is encouraging the doctor to look at particular things, but then the doctor can still better judge than the best algorithms. And that's this algorithm of hybrid."
2339.74,2372.1,"This principle of hybrid intelligence where you try to combine the best of both modes. Data science has many dimensions, right? And I will show you in a minute a sheep with five legs, right? So a data scientist is like somebody that needs to have many different skills. And one of the reasons is that there are multiple dimensions that you need to deal with. So for example, there are different types of data."
2372.1,2400.18,"There are tabular data. There are images. There is event data. There is time series data. In this course, there's also text data. So in this course, you will see all of these different types of data. Right? It's not one thing. There are different types of tasks. In a minute, I will talk about the difference between supervised and unsupervised. So supervised means that you are looking for something specific."
2400.43,2426.53,"Unsupervised means that you want to be surprised. You want to learn something that you did not know before without looking for something specific. Is the machine doing it or is the human doing this? Related to that question is, are we using an algorithm or are we looking at the visualization? So there will be two lectures devoted to visualization."
2426.53,2456.14,"And you will see surprising things that you with a human eye can see something in one millisecond that an algorithm is not able to pick up. And vice versa. Flexibility versus usability. So you will be using Python in this course. In Python, there are millions of different libraries that you can apply. So it's extremely flexible, but it's not supporting you."
2456.14,2486.35,"in a lot of ways, right? You need to compose these different things. There may be dedicated tools which are much more usable by end users, but are, let's say, just there for a specific task. Scalability versus quality. It may be the case that I can give an approximate answer in half a second, and I can give a very precise answer by computing, let's say, two months."
2486.51,2515.06,"What are you going to do? So many algorithms have trade-offs where you simply stop it if the quality is sufficient. And there is responsibility versus utility. So if you are willing to give up certain privacy aspects or certain fairness aspects, it may be that you get much better results. And that's another trade-off that we will look at."
2515.06,2544.34,"very much at the end of this course. So this leads to sheep with five legs. So in the Dutch language, this is a very common expression, right? Only when I moved to Germany, I realized that like this is not like a universal concept that is very much known. So this means that you have a person that is combining very different skills that are very difficult to find in a single person."
2544.34,2574.08,"But it's very important that these things are being combined. And you can see that here a bit if you look at the diversity of the topics that I talk about. In German, there is something similar, right? If I translate it, it's an egg-laying, will make pilk, which is exactly the same thing, right? That you need to combine. So on the one hand, you need to be able to program in Python. On the other side, you need to be able to reason about ethical decisions."
2574.08,2608.91,"And that's the spectrum that you look at. Any questions so far? Yeah? Good. I think we're well on time. So what are the topics that we will talk about in this course? So there is the infrastructure part. And I hope with my example of, let's say, learning these large language models, that my computer needs 600,000..."
2608.91,2634.77,"years to compute something like that, is showing that infrastructure is something very important. There is the analysis part, let's say turning data and these algorithms to get particular results. And this is, let's say, more these aspects related to, let's say, fairness, confidentiality, etc. And we will look at all three of them."
2634.77,2663.97,"but the part in the middle will have the emphasis. So scalability, making things fast and scalable, answering questions, either to supervised or unsupervised questions. So here I'm quoting Rumsfeld, which is kind of showing that often you do not know what you're looking for. These techniques can provide you insights that you are not asking for."
2663.97,2694.21,"And doing all of this in a responsible way. I'll briefly come back to this point later. So the focus is on the middle part. Then, like another way to look at it, so that you see, let's say, also how broad this course is, there are four questions that you can ask in any situation. And they basically show you the essence of what data science is. The first question sounds very weird."
2694.21,2725.31,"What has happened? So imagine that I'm running, let's say, the data science program, and I see that many students are, let's say, dropping out. I could ask the first question, what has happened? Where are the students? Where are they in the curriculum? What did they actually do? So that's the first question. The second question is then, why did it happen?"
2725.31,2753.89,"So if students, I don't know, suddenly disappeared from the program or were very inactive for a very long time, I would like to understand what is the cause of this. And I could, for example, that if students take a particular course and after that they stop. They give up and go away. That's not the case, by the way. But you can apply this in any situation."
2753.89,2784.4,"So for example, you could look at hospital data. You first try to understand how are patients flowing through the system. And then you see something that is worth investigating. And you ask yourself the question, why is this the case? Then if you understand why things are happening, you can also often predict it. So we have several, let's say, data science machine learning related projects."
2784.69,2814.32,"related to education, and we build a prototype. It's called AI Study Buddy, which is giving recommendations to students what to do based on experiences of previous students. And this is based on the prediction that under these and these circumstances, somebody's likely to be successful or not. If you're able to predict what is going to happen,"
2814.32,2850.85,"you can also give recommendations. So what is the best that can happen? So these are typically the types of questions that you look at in a business situation. Yeah? Now we go more down to earth. We start, let's say, talking about different types of data. Sorry, yeah? Sorry? This is four. So one, what happened? Why did it happen? What will happen next?"
2850.85,2878.58,"And then what is the best that can happen? So like giving a recommendation or making a decision. Yeah? Okay. So different types of data. There is structured data and unstructured data. In this course, we will talk, if you look at the unstructured part, mostly about text. If we talk about unstructured data."
2878.58,2907.89,"We will rarely talk about, let's say, images or video or something like that because there would be dedicated courses for that. The majority of the data that we will look at is structured data because that's the easiest and that is typically the starting point. If you look at structured data, then there is this taxonomy, and this taxonomy, I think, explains itself."
2907.89,2933.97,"Probably the things where you're, let's say, struggling is what is the difference between nominal and ordinal? And what is the difference between interval and ratio data? These are probably the things that are unclear. The rest explains itself. If I add some more detail, so if things are numeric, then I can do plus and equal and stuff like that."
2933.97,2962.3,"If it's discrete, it typically is like a natural number, something that I can count. Then continuous means that it can also be, let's say, values like, I don't know, 3.14 or something like that. And then the difference between these two things is that ratio data has a zero that has a meaning. Interval data, there is no zero or the zero has no meaning. So how to interpret this?"
2962.3,2989.42,"I can say my car is two times as fast as your car. Or, I don't know, this laptop is twice as heavy as this laptop. And I can say that because there is a zero. I can say two times, et cetera, et cetera. So that's the difference between these two things. If I look at degrees centigrade, I cannot say..."
2989.42,3019.63,"that, I don't know, fourth degree centigrade is two times as warm as two degrees centigrade. That would not make any sense. That's because the zero does not have a meaning, in the sense that I just indicated. If you look at categorical data, there is a difference between nominal and ordinal. Nominal means that there is no order. So this could be something like red, green, blue."
3020.46,3049.04,"With ordinal, there is an order. I don't know, very good, good, average, bad, very bad. That has a clear ordering. And although these are not numbers, they are ordered. So that's the thing. So here I'm showing you examples. So a date would be interval data. Of course, if you're very religious, you can think, I don't know,"
3049.04,3072.5,"one, one, year zero as a particular meaning, but you cannot talk in terms of, let's say, two times something. If you look at the dropout rate or at the speed or a weight or something like that, you can, so a dropout rate of 33% is half of a dropout rate of 66%. I think you can interpret it in this way."
3072.78,3102.69,"Colors would be nominal, something like medium, average, very good, etc. would be ordinal. Here are some other examples that you can look at. So that is structured data, and most of the time we will be talking about this. Then there is unstructured data, and typically this unstructured data, what we will see is that if you look at an image,"
3102.69,3130.5,"In the end, these are pixels, and in the end, these are simply numbers. So things are not super different. But typically, there is a transformation that is there. And for many types of data, there are dedicated techniques. The only, let's say, area where we will, if we talk about unstructured data, where we will go deeper, is when we talk about text. For text, we will do lots of dedicated things to that."
3130.5,3161.66,"we will not go into video or images or something like that. So most of the cases, we will look at tabular data like this. And the terms that we are using is these are called features, the column names. The rows are called instances, right? That's the terms that we are using. So if I try to map the things here on the different types of data that we had before, so this was for structured data."
3161.66,3191.7,"You can, for example, this order ID, although it looks like a number, I made it here a nominal categorical variable because this is just an identifier. It does not mean something. If the order number is twice the order number of another order, it doesn't mean anything. It's just like an ID. Date was interval data. Price is clearly retro data."
3191.86,3220.91,"Here is another example, and here you can see, let's say, some text messages, images, et cetera, et cetera. So tabular data, we have features, and we have instances. So the rows are instances, the columns are features. Features may be raw or derived, and you can do computations over this. We will spend a lot of time talking about time."
3221.14,3250.74,"So we will talk about, for example, time series data. We will talk about sequence data. We will talk about process mining data, event data. Times plays a very special role in data science. And you will see many techniques devoted to that. And we talk about labeled data and unlabeled data. And if we talk about labeled data, we distinguish between two types of features, descriptive features and target features."
3251.18,3280.4,"And I will come back to that later. So if you look at label data, there is a target feature that is typically called the label. And if you do supervised learning, you try to predict or to understand this label in terms of the other features. And you try to learn a function that given certain values here leads to a particular value."
3280.46,3307.86,"And you do this for prediction or you do this for diagnosis. These are the reasons that you do. And as I said, there are many different books that you can look at, many different papers. And there are, for all of the terms that I'm using, and I will also be very sloppy myself, right? So descriptive features are also called predictive variables or independent variables."
3308.21,3340.43,"Target feature is also called the response variable or a dependent variable. And these names are also indicating you would like to explain this in terms of that. In terms of instances, we will also talk about cases, objects, records, all kinds of names that you can think of. So these are the rows in the table that we look at. This is unlabeled data. Right here, I did not pick a specific target feature."
3340.43,3367.73,"Then we come to a very important distinction, and if you look at the study guide, that for many techniques we are explicitly indicating is it supervised or unsupervised. So if it's supervised, we are looking for something very specific. So our data is labeled, we have a target feature, and we are trying to understand why is this target feature there. Can we predict when it's there?"
3368.05,3398.21,"If you look at unsupervised learning, you're trying to find out something about your data without looking for a specific target feature. In this example here, in supervised learning, I'm trying to separate my instances in the green and the red ones, and this is the line separating this. So this is supervised learning. My data was labeled red."
3398.21,3427.42,or green and i try to find the function separating these in this example my data was not labeled let's say all the faces do not have a color but based on their attributes i try to find homogeneous groups of instances that are close to each other right so if i would look at student data i could have as if i would do supervised learning
3427.42,3453.49,"For example, I would like to predict when a student is finished based on some input data. That would be supervised learning. I want to know a specific thing. Will a student succeed or when will a student finish? If I look at unsupervised learning, I would look at, okay, I do not know anything about these students and why they are successful."
3453.49,3484.02,"I just want to find out homogeneous groups of students that have very similar characteristics. And based on that, learn something about the data. To explain this in more detail, the goal of supervised learning is that you have a target feature, here red or green, and you would like to learn a function that is saying, is the feature now going to be red or green? That's supervised learning."
3485.1,3516.78,"And the goal is to find a rule or a function that is separating these things. So this example, our target feature here is binary. It's a categorical feature. We just have two values, red and green. The target feature can also be numerical. So here the green dots are corresponding to my instances. So the green dots are my instances."
3516.78,3543.26,"X is, let's say, the feature based on which I try to learn this target feature Y. And if I show it like this, of course, here we have just one descriptive feature and one target feature. You can see very easily that the idea is to learn a function. So based on examples, the green dots, we try to learn a function F."
3543.26,3573.86,"that is explaining y in terms of x, based on a bunch of examples. So we can think of supervised learning as learning a function. Very simple. Here the function has, let's say, a numerical target feature. In this example that we had before, it's also about learning a function, but now the target feature is binary."
3573.86,3603.28,"It's red or green. And my instances, if I show it like this, so every instance has an x1 and x2 coordinate, and based on this, it is labeled either red or not. Do we understand this? So supervised learning is basically learning a function. That's all it is. And if you think about a neural network, you can think of this as a function."
3603.28,3629.58,It's a network. And now you can look at more complicated data. So this is our dog Miffy. You also saw it on the picture at the beginning. So I can look at a bunch of pixels here. And these correspond to a bunch of numbers. Can be done in different ways. This is input to a neural network. And of course it has much more pixels than what I'm showing you here. And we try to predict.
3629.58,3655.28,"whether it's a dog, a cat, or an elephant, or something else. So this is a neural network, and it's a function that tries to learn this data, the pixels, into a classifier what kind of animal it is. That's a basic idea. So neural networks is nothing else than a function."
3655.34,3683.41,"And this function has many different weights inside. So every connection here has a particular weight. And we can kind of change the weight of these connections. And the idea is then very simple. It's the idea of gradient descent. So if I go back here, perhaps that is easiest way to explain. So here, this is perfectly fitting. So my error is zero."
3683.47,3710.43,"But suppose that I have a training data that would be at this position, right? If there is data at this position, then there would be an error. And the neural network would try to, let's say, reduce that error. And under very specific circumstances, there is something that works as follows. The only thing that you have to do is walk down, right? Just as you can see here."
3710.43,3740.67,"This is the error. The error is now at this level, and you try to reduce the error. And if you formulate your problem in the proper way, and you will see many examples of that, the only thing that you have to do is walk down, reducing the error. And of course, smart people immediately say, but what happens if there are local minima, et cetera, et cetera? So you should carefully, let's say, formulate your problem in such a way that that doesn't happen. And that's the idea."
3740.67,3767.98,"that is typically behind it. So examples of supervised learning would be does a patient recover? Does a student drop out? Is an order delivered on time based on lots of other features, right? You can all imagine things there. Supervised learning is very different because now we do not have a target feature."
3768.37,3797.98,"We just see data, and we try to find certain patterns, certain groups. So that's the basic idea. So the two main things that you see here is, let's say, finding clusters of homogeneous sets of instances and patterns. So in this course, you will learn things like, for example, k-means, k-medoids, different clustering algorithms that are doing that. And you will look at pattern mining."
3797.98,3825.84,"So for example, one of the things that we will talk about is association rules, right? If this and this happens, then also that happens, right? And it's surprising because it happens more often than what based on the data you would expect. So examples, I already said it, finding similar groups and finding patterns or groups of things happening together."
3825.87,3854.02,"One of the standard examples we will often refer to is, let's say, supermarket data. So a typical supermarket has, I don't know, 50,000 until 100,000 different products, depending where you go. There are many different products, and you see customers buying specific combinations of products, right? So what does the data look like? You can think of it as a big table."
3854.02,3881.79,"where you have 100,000 columns, one for every product, and you have as many rows as, I don't know, the people that have visited your shop, right? And you can say each time a person comes to the shop again, it's a new row in the table. So you can all imagine what the input data is. So now I'm running the supermarket, and I would like to understand this. And then..."
3881.79,3904.34,"One of the things that you can do is, let's say, pattern mining. I don't know, people that, I don't know, buy beer also buy chips or something like that. That would be obvious, but perhaps there are things that are very surprising in the data. And you can find clusters. So there are groups of customers that are, let's say, buying the same stuff."
3904.72,3932.37,"The same is that I could look at the Spotify data or your Apple Music data. Think again, every column corresponds to a song. Every row corresponds to somebody that is using Spotify or Apple Music or whatever. And you try to find patterns there. Also think about something like Netflix. Every column would be a movie."
3932.37,3961.68,"Every row would be a subscriber to Netflix, looking at stuff. One is not looking for something very specific. One tries to understand what are homogeneous groups of customers or viewers, and what are things that are surprising. If I know that, I don't know, that it's very surprising that people that watch that and watch that also often watch that, I can..."
3961.68,3993.26,"use this, right, in marketing and all kinds of other things. Okay. Sorry, as I said, this course is a bit atypical because, like, I'm loading lots of, let's say, general stuff on you. Like, in later lectures, it will be more specific. If you go to this domain, then terms play a role. So, for some people, for people in the streets, AI and data science and machine learning,"
3993.26,4023.17,"And deep learning, it's all the same thing, right? It's very unclear what the differences are. It's very much a matter of taste, like how you, let's say, classify them. Like this is a bit closer to what I would say, right? Where like AI and machine learning and NLP, et cetera, all of these things are relating into a particular way. You need to form yourself an image."
4023.17,4047.25,"Like if you look at these terms, where you think they fit, right? Sometimes when people talk about AI, they mean something very general, even Excel, right? At other times, they mean something very specific, just backpropagation in a neural network, right? That's sometimes confusing."
4047.66,4074.45,"Also, our understanding of AI and data science and everything is changing. Here you see a bunch of quotes. For example, if it's useful, it isn't AI. Or if you understand how it works, it isn't AI. I like this one. As soon as it works, nobody calls it AI anymore."
4075.15,4104.96,"And this shows the drift in these, let's say, terms that we are using. Another topic is the data science process. So if you are doing a data science project and you cannot, so it's very difficult for us to experiment that here. So even if you do your hands-on assignments, you kind of get the data sent handed to you, right? And by that, we are basically skipping."
4104.96,4133.39,"the part that is probably most difficult in practice, right? And that is finding the data, extracting the data. So if you look at the data science process, there are several, let's say, life cycle models. Here you can see some acronyms. I do not want to go in detail. But they show you the different phases of a data science project. And this analysis part, the part that we will focus on, you have to understand that this is just"
4133.52,4162.88,"let's say, a smaller part of something that is typically much bigger. We will touch upon it at a few places, but not go into a lot of detail. So people in this business, they typically say that 80% is spent on data preparation and only 20% is spent on analysis. And yet in a course like this, we are spending most of the time on analysis."
4162.88,4192.0,"because that's the fun part that we would like to talk about. The other part is also difficult to recreate in a university environment. You need to be in a business to really see that things that seem very simple are actually not so simple at all. You're dealing with things like personnel, privacy concerns, etc."
4192.0,4224.82,"making things difficult. So for example, like a typical question that I ask, I think very few of you have exposure to SAP in some way, but most of the larger organizations in the Western world are using SAP, right? So how many tables does an SAP installation have? Who wants to make a guess? Yeah."
4225.49,4254.85,"10,000, what does the rest think? So it depends on the installation, but here you can see a particular SAP installation that has 800,000 different tables. So this shows that the problem, okay, do you have this data, is not a question that you can very easily answer. If you have a specific question, then you need to go into this system."
4254.85,4280.86,"look at all the table names that typically have, let's say, horrible German acronyms associated to that, that are pure torture for people using the system. And this is not so easy. Also, if you would go, I don't know, to a hospital information system, for example, here in Klinikum, what you will see is that they do not have one system. They have hundreds of systems."
4280.86,4311.44,"And in each of these systems, you may find tens of thousands of tables. So these are the challenges that are difficult. We distinguish between two, let's say, extraction principles. This is the one that you probably heard about, that is most famous. Extract, transform, load. And it just talks about you have your information system, for example, SAP with 800,000 tables."
4311.44,4341.04,You want to extract data that is relevant to you. Then you transform it and you load it into your data warehouse that is being used for your analysis. So this is ETL. And you should look at the order of transform and load. So you first transform and then you load it. And you can think of this as bottled water.
4341.68,4370.53,"And why do I use bottled water here? Like if I put water in bottles, it has one intended meaning that, I don't know, a person is going to drink it, right? So it's prepared for a particular use. Most people do not buy bottled water to take a shower or something like that, right? That would be very unusual. So this is ETL. You prepare the data for a particular..."
4370.53,4400.77,"analytics purpose. If you look at the other paradigm, extract, load, and transform, note that these two have swapped positions, you extract and load the data from the information system, then you dump it into a data lake, and you only transform it on demand when you have specific questions. So in terms of bottled water, you can think of this as a data lake."
4400.77,4427.14,"That's why it's called like that. So we talk about data warehouses and data lakes. The water, the data is simply dumped in it. And if you have a very specific question, you try to, let's say, transform it in the way that is necessary for that. So these are the two paradigms. We're almost at an end."
4427.14,4455.74,and so let's now let's say look at some of the challenges that will be recurring while you are taking this course one challenge will be to distinguish between overfitting and underfitting right so if i would ask you right i would now like to learn a model where i try to predict your birth date right
4455.74,4483.92,"I'm trying to, so on the y-axis, I have your birth date. And I could simply say, I don't know, I use the feature male or female. And based on this feature, I would look at the average of all the males and the females in this room. I would look at that average, and then I would say that is what I predict. So whenever I have a male, then I predict, I don't know, this number."
4484.37,4514.45,"That would be something that is underfitting, right? I'm making a prediction, but I'm not really using the data. Another thing that I could do is that I could use as input your, I don't know, your, let's say, your zip code and, I don't know, the color of your car. Assume that everybody has a car or something like that, right?"
4514.45,4544.78,"then I would get an overfitting model. Probably for most of you, based on your, what did I say? Zip code and the color of your car, probably most of you would be uniquely identifiable. So I would learn a function like this, which would be a perfect classifier in this room, but if I would take it to the next lecture room, it would fail miserably."
4544.88,4570.1,"So that is explaining in a nutshell overfitting and underfitting. And the only way to address this phenomenon is that when you are training your model, it is forbidden to use everything. Because if you are using everything and you are not reserving some data to evaluate how good that your model is, you would see something like this."
4570.1,4599.63,"In the early example, zip codes and color of the car. If I would separate, let's say, 30 people in this room, I would not use it for training. And then I would apply the model. It would probably fail miserably, right, on these 30 people. Although it worked perfectly for the rest of the class. Another, let's say, very well-known problem is, let's say, in the data we often find correlations."
4599.63,4630.74,"So if people eat ice cream, they get sunburns, right? Or when people get sunburns to make the pain less miserable, they start eating ice cream, right? That's a correlation. But it is not that ice cream is causing sunburn, right? I think most of the people will agree with that. And the reason is that there is a hidden variable, in this case the weather,"
4630.74,4660.43,"that is, let's say, influencing these two things. So in the data, we often find correlations, but you need to be very careful about this. So for example, we will look at things like Shapley values, where we try to look at these things in a more careful way. But if this is all the data that you have, it is very difficult to decide is this now correlation or a causality."
4660.43,4689.58,"You need, again, as human to interpret the data in a meaningful way. We want our results to be, let's say, meaningful. Nobody pays for analysis. People only pay for improvement. So what you need to do is you get data, you get insights, but it doesn't stop here. You need to be able to take action."
4689.71,4715.63,"As I mentioned earlier, like I'm a process miner, we can diagnose, let's say, processes and organizations why things are failing, but Solonus would not be able to charge large amounts of money for their software if it is not, let's say, these insights are not transformed into actions. So that's a very important thing."
4716.34,4745.49,"So your data science results need to be relevant, specific, timely, we'll talk about in a minute, novel and clear. So if you're stating something that is obvious that everybody already knew, that may be in the data, but it's not interesting. You need to have information that is original and that you can still use to take action. So if you're in a car here and you get a prediction you're in a traffic jam, that's not very useful."
4745.84,4775.76,"If you're walking here, suppose that your data science algorithm would warn you one minute before, it may be too late already. But if you know it two hours before, then that information is valuable. Things like that. Then, of course, there are things related to ethical parts, responsible data science."
4775.79,4806.4,"Specifically at the end of this lecture series, we will have a few lectures devoted to this, where we go very deep. And these will show you things that are very counterintuitive. So for example, one of the things that you will see is to make sure that your algorithm is fair, you should use attributes that are sensitive. Because that's the only way to ensure that an algorithm is fair."
4806.4,4836.21,"Because otherwise that would not work. So fairness will be one topic. So how to avoid unfair conclusions even if they are true. Sometimes you want to force the algorithm. So it's not enough to not use data. You should force it to be fair. That's the only way that that works. Accuracy. So how to avoid that thing. So if you get the data science results,"
4836.21,4866.58,"How reliable is it? Confidentiality. Doing all of that without leaking information. We will see various ways of measuring this aspect. K-anonymity, L-diversity. These are some of the terms that we will look at. Transparency. How to clarify answers in such a way that they become indisputable."
4866.58,4896.46,"Often, if you apply a data science pipeline, it's the same as the game that you play as a child. So one person says something to the next person, says something to the next person, says something to the next person. What comes out at the end can be a completely different message. So if you talk about transparency, it is to make sure that in the end, the result, you know how it is based."
4896.46,4924.21,"ignore that there was this pipeline before it. So hopefully this gave you, let's say, some insights into what lies ahead for you. As I said, data science has many faces. This lecture is a bit atypical. Also, the next lecture will be a bit atypical. The lectures after that, they will go more into, let's say, specific algorithms there."
4924.5,4942.03,"So at the end of every lecture, I will show the program. So we are now here. On Wednesday, we will look at data exploration, et cetera. And then in the exercises, you will play with the things that you've seen then. See you on Wednesday."
